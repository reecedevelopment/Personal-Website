                    Hello. As you've seen, I am Zachary Reece. I'm an 18-year-old from Derby, KS with a passion for cyber security and web development. I started learning HTML when I was nine years old, and ever since then things have sort of snowballed. Almost everything I know is self taught, as I read and watch informational videos as much as possible, always trying to keep up to date with the latest in the tech world. My goal in life is to bring the intersection of clean usability and effective security to the world. On the academic side of things, I have a 34 Composite ACT Score, and was selected as a 2017 National Merit Scholarship Semifinalist, ranking me within the top 1% of high school students in the nation. When it comes to design I am a minimalist. As Steve Jobs said about the Apple II, simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. I am a big fan of classic rock, specifically The Beatles and Pink Floyd, but also other legends like Tom Petty and Creedence Clearwater Revival. I like to read, I love to learn, I like to have fun, take risks, and experience life to its fullest capabilities.
